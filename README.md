# Keywords and Variables

After completing the simple python tutorial your kids will develop proficiency in the Python framework and eventually about creating and building fun games and projects

| Term            | What It Means                                    |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| **Class**       | A recipe or blueprint for creating objects       |
| **Object**      | A real item made using the class                 |
| **Method**      | A function that belongs to an object             |
| **Data member** | A variable that stores information in the object |

# Data types
Every value in Python has a datatype. Since everything is an object in Python programming, data types are classes and variables are instances (object) of these classes. Listed below are some of the most important data types in Python. Int, Float, Complex, List, Tuple, Strings, Set, and Dictionary

# Operators
Some special symbols are called Operators in Python for carrying out arithmetic or logical computations.

# Arithmetic Operators:
<br>
Operator
<br>
Example
<br>
5+3 = 8(addition)
6-2 = 4(subtraction) / 8/4 = 2(division)
3*2 = 6(multiplication) % 5%2 = 1(gives the remainder of 5/2) // 6//5 = 1(Floor division - division that results in the whole number adjusted to the left in the number line) ** 3**2 = 9(3 to the power 2)
Like the Arithmetic Operators, we have some other operators with some specialized functions. Some of the most important ones are mentioned below.
<br>
Comparison Operators, Logical Operators, Bitwise Operators, Assignment Operators, Identity Operators, and Membership Operators.
<br>
‚ÄãThe Python shell can perform the above arithmetic operations because it is an interpreter where you can execute your Python code and commands. The Python shell has many other features, including adding a shell page.

# Functions
A function is a set of related statements which perform a particular task. This helps us to break our program into small modules which helps a coder to handle the codes when the code size is very large.

# Loops
<br>
Loops are nothing but as the name itself suggests, it is a set of instructions that are repeated until a certain condition is reached. In this structure, there is a question which on being asked an action is executed for generating the answer and keeps on repeating the question till you no longer need to act.

The different types of loops are as follows:
<br>
While Loop: tests the condition before execution of the body of the loop
<br>
For Loop: abbreviates the code of the managing loop variable and executes a sequence of statements multiple times
<br>
Nested Loops: these are used within other loops


# What Is an Object and a Class üß± ?
üí° Think of a class as a recipe and an object as the real cupcake made from that recipe! üç∞
<br>
üß± Example: Let's Build a Dog Class!
üê∂ Step-by-step:
We will create a Dog class, and then use it to make some dog objects.
<br>

# What's Happening üß†?
<br>
class Dog: ‚Äî this is our blueprint for any dog.
<br>
__init__ is a special method that runs when we make a new dog. It sets the name and age.
<br>
self.name and self.age are data members ‚Äî they belong to each dog.
<br>
bark() and birthday() are methods ‚Äî they belong to the dog and do actions.
