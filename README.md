# Arithmetic Operators:
<br>
Operator
<br>
Example
<br>
5+3 = 8(addition)
6-2 = 4(subtraction) / 8/4 = 2(division)
3*2 = 6(multiplication) % 5%2 = 1(gives the remainder of 5/2) // 6//5 = 1(Floor division - division that results in the whole number adjusted to the left in the number line) ** 3**2 = 9(3 to the power 2)
Like the Arithmetic Operators, we have some other operators with some specialized functions. Some of the most important ones are mentioned below.
<br>
Comparison Operators, Logical Operators, Bitwise Operators, Assignment Operators, Identity Operators, and Membership Operators.
<br>
â€‹The Python shell can perform the above arithmetic operations because it is an interpreter where you can execute your Python code and commands. The Python shell has many other features, including adding a shell page.

# Functions
A function is a set of related statements which perform a particular task. This helps us to break our program into small modules which helps a coder to handle the codes when the code size is very large.

# Loops
<br>
Loops are nothing but as the name itself suggests, it is a set of instructions that are repeated until a certain condition is reached. In this structure, there is a question which on being asked an action is executed for generating the answer and keeps on repeating the question till you no longer need to act.
